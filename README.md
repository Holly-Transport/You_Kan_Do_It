# You_Kan_Do_It
You Kan Do It is a simple desktop kanban-style task management application, with an SQLite database for storing task info.

There are four default categories -- To Do, In Progress, Procrastinate, and Complete. Users can add/edit/recategorize/delete tasks on the board. 
Since the application does not include login features, it is recommended for desktop use only.
